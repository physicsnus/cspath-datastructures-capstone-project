1. Which data structure(s) did you use for part 1? Why did you select these data structures?

For part 1 of this project, I simply store the different type of food in a LinkedList.

2. What is the runtime (in asymptotic notation) of searching for a food type? Do you think there is a more efficient runtime?

Therefore, for N different food types, the runtime for searching a food type is O(N). That's because the programme will have to go through all N different food types to determine if any of them starts with the input string, provided by the user.

3. Which data structures did you use for part 2? Why did you select these data structures?

For part 1 of this project, I simply store the restaurants in a HashMap. The food type provides the key, while the value is a List of restaurants that serve that particular food type.

4. What is the runtime (in asymptotic notation) of retrieving the restaurant data? Do you think there is a more efficient runtime?

If there are N restaurants, the runtime for retrieving the relevant restaurants (in accordance to the input user) is O(N). That's because, in the situation where all N restaurants serve the same type of food, the programme will have to reiterate N times to retieve them all.

5. Outside of this project, what are other innovative ways you can utilize data structures?

I suppose we could use HashMap to store username-password data.
